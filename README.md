# ccleste

This is a C source port of the [original celeste (Celeste classic)](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145) for the PICO-8.

This is only a platform agnostic reimplementation of the original lua code. Meaning that it has no external dependencies (only the C standard library), it can be seen as the "backend" of the game; it's just the raw game logic without any assets or anything.

Eventually there will be documentation for this.

Check out https://github.com/lemon-sherbet/allegro-ccleste for a playable frontend.
